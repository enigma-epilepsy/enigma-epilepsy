# ENIGMA Consortium
The ENIGMA Consortium is an international collaboration of leading researchers from around the world. It combines experts in imaging genomics, neurology, and psychiatry to understand brain structure and function using MRI, DTI, fMRI, genetic data, and various patient groups.

# ENIGMA-Epilepsy Mission
The ENIGMA Epilepsy Working Group is dedicated to improving our understanding of the in vivo neuroanatomical disruptions observed in people with epilepsy compared to healthy individuals. The consortium is co-chaired by Professor Sisodiya (UCL, UK) and Professor Carrie McDonald (UCSD, USA).
