<h2><strong><span>The ENIGMA Consortium</span></strong></h2>
<p><strong><span><a class="broken_link" href="https://enigma.ini.usc.edu/about/consortium/">The ENIGMA Consortium&#160;</a></span></strong>is an international effort by leaders worldwide. The Consortium brings together researchers in imaging genomics, neurology and psychiatry, to understand brain structure and function, based on MRI, DTI, fMRI, genetic data and many patient populations.</p>

<h2>ENIGMA-Epilepsy Mission</h2>
<p>As the ENIGMA Epilepsy Working Group, we are dedicated to improving our understanding of in vivo neuroanatomical disruptions in people with epilepsy compared to healthy individuals in the general population. The consortium's co-chairs include Professor Sisodiya (</p>
<p>UCL, UK), and Professor Carrie McDonald (UCSD, USA).</p>

<p>ENIGMA-Epilepsy's first study of grey matter abnormalities across the common epilepsies was published in Brain. A follow-up investigation of white matter abnormalities was recently published, alongside several secondary research projects. The main objectives of ENIGMA-Epilepsy include:</p>
<ul>
<li>To create a worldwide network of epilepsy neuroimaging centers.</li>
<li>To collect summary statistics on brain shape, brain volume, and brain wiring from thousands of people with epilepsy and thousands of neurologically healthy controls.</li>
<li>To compare and contrast these measures in affected/unaffected groups and, accordingly, illustrate possible differences between the two.</li>
<li>To identify structural differences between the major forms of epilepsy and major types of seizure.</li>
<li>To develop collaborations and infrastructure for future analyses.</li>
</ul>
